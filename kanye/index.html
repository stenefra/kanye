		<p>I&rsquo;ve always hated the use of the N-word and Kanye and Jay Z became the face of advocacy to reclaim the term. Where they saw it as a way of taking that power away from white people, I saw an increase in white people using the word and they used Kanye as their &ldquo;black friend&rdquo; card. As far as I was concerned, he was setting us back by decades.</p>
		<p>But my biggest reason for hating Kanye lied more with myself. At 12 years old I was sporting some serious internal racism and I refused to allow myself to like anything associated with black people. This meant altering what I wore, the way I talked and the music I could listen to.</p>
		<p>The devil had me in his grasp and it looked like the end of the line for me.</p>
		<p>And then I went to college and met a special group of white people. Like angels they came to me in my time of need and they played the legendary gospel tunes of &ldquo;My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>At first, I refused to listen. I wasn&rsquo;t ready to be saved yet and they knew I would have to come to Yeezus at my own time.</p>
		<p>Little did we know, that time was approaching.</p>
		<p>Sept. 21, 2015 was the day my life changed forever.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

		<p>I was just nodding my head waiting for Nicki Minaj&rsquo;s verse when I heard the line, &ldquo;My presence is a present, kiss my ass.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>I replayed the song to hear it again and again and every time I did the pure exhaustion with human beings emanating from that single line resonated stronger within me. It was like the clouds parted and the sun rained down on me like the grace of God and I felt at peace for the first time in years as I accepted Yeezus into my heart.</p>

	<p>At this point, it&rsquo;s useless to question Kanye West&rsquo;s long-tried fashion career.</p>

	<p>Yes, he promoted a line over the course of four years that never saw the light of day. Yes, he created not one, but two whole collections of pantyhose bodysuits in the same calendar year. And yes, he once classified his style as being, &ldquo;50 percent rock 'n' roll, 50 percent hip-hop, 50 percent genius.&rdquo;   Nevertheless, as questionable as West&rsquo;s sartorial exploits have been through his 10-year stint, we all still seem to care, as can be seen by the instantaneous sell out of the Yeezy Season 3 show scheduled for this afternoon.</p>

	<p>There is an understood set of rules for celebrities-turned-designers, which typically most adhere to during their brief fashion ventures. </p>

<div class="row article">
	<div class="col-md-offset-2 col-md-5 body-copy">
		<p>Over these past 10 years, West has broken every single one of them: crowding other designers out of their fashion week time slots, publicly bashing the industry&rsquo;s top critics and announcing his collections just weeks before their arrival like a Beyonc&eacute; world tour.</p>

		<p>Even still, West has garnered considerate recognition for what his designs deserve, questioning if anyone can break into the fashion industry as long as he has mastered one element: spectacle, an art we&rsquo;ve seen time and time again in both his music and fashion careers. </p>

	<p>In 2008 when West released the much anticipated &ldquo;808s &amp; Heartbreak,&rdquo; his transition to electropop influences wasn&rsquo;t initially welcomed. </p>

	<p>While his success from &ldquo;Graduation&rdquo; had anchored him a strong spot in the music industry, he chose to shift gears, producing more minimalistic sounds with the usage of new Auto-Tune and 808 drum technology.</p>

	<div class="show-mobile"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet show-mobile" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@ fitting <a href="https://t.co/dVS7sedQVH">pic.twitter.com/dVS7sedQVH</a></p>&mdash; KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) <a href="https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/696813552020123648">February 8, 2016</a></blockquote>
	<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>

	<p>This move hit controversy, but West simultaneously found spectacle, ranking number one on the Billboard 200 and gaining platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America. </p>

	<p>Much in the same way, spectacle has become an essential in West&rsquo;s fashion career.</p>

	<p>Fashion shows don&rsquo;t normally feature drill sergeants commanding models to march along the runway. In turn, models don&rsquo;t usually shuffle along catwalks smoking cigarettes or fidgeting with their hair.</p>

	<p>Oddities as they are, these were the spectacles which ruffled fashion&rsquo;s feathers in West&rsquo;s past seasons.</p>

	<p>&ldquo;This second round of drab, broken-down basics proved he can&rsquo;t be taken seriously as a designer, but nevertheless many people in fashion do seem to take West seriously &mdash; they keep showing up expectantly for his performances,&rdquo; critic Kathy Horyn wrote in The Cut after seeing West&rsquo;s Yeezy Season 2 last fall. </p>

	<div class="show-mobile"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@ fitting / knit <a href="https://t.co/dGpyfBkXoS">pic.twitter.com/dGpyfBkXoS</a></p>&mdash; KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) <a href="https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/696815451280707584">February 8, 2016</a></blockquote>
	<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>

	<p>Designers don&rsquo;t rent out Madison Square Garden&rsquo;s 18,200 seats for a fall line. Nor do they hire 1,200 cast members to participate in their show.</p>

	<p>Spectacles yet again, these are the exact plans of Yeezy Season 3, as West hinted on his Twitter account and an online casting call.</p>

	<p>Although the entire point of spectacle is to surprise the unassuming, it is quite fun to wonder what sort of show will be put on this afternoon.</p>

	<p>With 1200 models, maybe we can expect a flash mob of sorts. Not only could this make an interesting form of entertainment for the attendees, but could even become a viral YouTube video, if we&rsquo;re so lucky.</p>

		<p>And because West has revealed his next album will be gospel-focused, maybe today will become an evangelical event, definitely deserving spectacle status.</p>

		<p>Whatever the case, Yeezy Season 3 is bound to be a collection worth its hype, not necessarily for the clothes, but for the show we can&rsquo;t dream of expecting. </p>
